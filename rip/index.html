			<h3>According to the government census of the United States, in 2019, out of 50 million college employed students only 14 percent worked in a STEM occupation and since 2016-2017 these
    		 percentages have decreased by 3 percent. An example of a discourse community in the STEM occupation would be front end developers in the software engineering field. Front end
    	 developers are the designers of technology and work hand in hand with back end developers, such as those with cybersecurity occupation. The goals in the front end developing discourse
     community are building a foundation for websites and programs, designing, and making them functional. The main medium of participating and communicating is through coding
    applications, such as Atom, Dreamweaver, or GitHub, where almost all the communication is in the form of codes. I found my discourse community when I took web development in high school, and
    once I earned my certifications I finally became apart of the community.</h3>

		<h3>Front end development is the practice of using coding languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a website or program so that users can access a website and interact with it.
			Front end development is about laying the foundation for a website or a program. By using these coding languages, front end developers are able to create websites that we all know;
			such as Google, D2L, and social media platforms like Twitter and Instagram. Front end development is broken down into three different parts. HTML are not only the words that are seen on a website
			but also the formatting of a website, like an MLA format essay. CSS involves the appearance of a website, so if a website has a certain color scheme or the text is a different font or size
			that is apart of CSS. Lastly there is JavaScript, JavaScript is what allows users of a website or program to interact with the interface. For example, if I were to look up a recipe for a cake
			at the very top I could press the Jump to Recipe button and it would scroll the page for me to show me the actual recipe rather than scrolling down myself.</h3>

		<h3>Almost anything can be a coding editor, if you can type words and symbols on a document then it can be classified as a coding editor. In the early days of coding and even now, front end developers used Microsofts Notepad in order
  	to write scripts and would then run the website or program in their browser or through Windows Command. Popular coding editors these days would consist of coding programs such as
  Adobe Dreamweaver, Atom, and Microsofts Visual Studios. However there is a popular coding website and editor called GitHub, it allows its users to upload their coding files and share it with others.
  People who are able to view these codes are able to provide feedback, edit, or even copy these codes. The beauty of GitHub is that it works hand in hand with coding editor programs such as Atom
  to make the upload process easier.</h3>

		<h3>Like how in the human body, organs work together in order to keep us alive, in the technology world, front end development is a component of technology that allows the internet and programs
  	to work the way that they do. In front-end development we do an exercise called backseat coding, where one person codes and the other person looks out for any errors and typos within the
  codes. Exercising like backseat coding allow for a front end development team to work together in order to produce code effectively and efficiently. Coding itself is considered a team sport
  and sometimes we need another pair of eyes to look at our work from a different perspective in order to catch any errors and do necessary revisions. Teamwork is a vital aspect in front end development,
  being able to plan out a website, having different roles in order to create one, and being able to help each other when we hit road blocks within our codes. In code editor programs, developers are able to work
  on the same code at the same time, allowing for easy teamwork and in coding editors we have a special set of characters that allow us to communicate with each other without interfering with our codes such as
  <--!> in HTML and //* in CSS. Then after making any corrections or the consideration of a revision we can easily respond back by typing our message within these characters and then deleting it to get rid of it
  in our final code.</h3>

		<h3>In the front end development discourse community we share the same goals when it comes to designing and making the front end of websites and programs. Although our communication is
  	almost strictly online, communication and teamwork is very vital in this community in order to help each other grow and figure out bugs and problems within our codes and being able to share our codes in
  	our community in order to help others. I chose this Community as my discourse community because it is apart of not only my major but what I like to do for fun. My discourse community branches out from the
  	 technology community and together we work hand in hand with other technology discourse communities.</h3>
